<!-- You must use at least 2 APIs together in a meaningful way that appropriately leverages or integrates their capabilities. 
    Don't just access 2 random APIs and display some data from each.

You must use an HTML <table> element as demonstrated as class to display some of your data.

Your page must be interactive -- taking input from the user via at least 3 of the following options: textbox, drop down menu, 
checkbox, radio button.  You should actually do something with the user's input. -->
